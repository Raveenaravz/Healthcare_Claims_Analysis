 🩺 Healthcare Claims Analysis Project

This project explores healthcare insurance data to uncover how factors like **smoking status**, **age**, **BMI**, and **region** impact medical charges. It demonstrates practical data analysis using Python, providing visual insights into what drives healthcare costs.

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project was created to analyze healthcare claims data and discover which features most influence insurance charges. The main goals are:

- ✅ Identify whether **smoking** increases medical costs.
- ✅ Understand how **age** and **BMI** relate to insurance charges.
- ✅ Compare **average costs across regions**.
- ✅ Practice using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** for real-world data analysis.
- ✅ Present insights in a clear, visual, and easy-to-understand way.

## 🛠️ How the Project Was Done

Here’s how I built and completed the project step by step:

1. **📥 Data Collection**  
   - Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle: [Medical Cost Personal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)

2. **📁 Project Setup**  
   - Created folders for raw data, notebooks, visuals, and scripts  
   - Used **VS Code with Jupyter Notebooks**

3. **🧼 Data Cleaning**  
   - Checked for missing values (none were found)
   - Removed duplicates  
   - Confirmed correct data types

4. **🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized **distribution of charges**
   - Compared **charges for smokers vs non-smokers**
   - Explored **age vs. charges** and **BMI vs. charges**
   - Compared **average charges by region**

5. **📊 Insights & Interpretation**  
   - Found that **smokers** are charged much higher  
   - Charges increase with **age** and **BMI**, especially when combined with smoking  
   - **Southeast region** has the highest average charges

6. **🗂️ Documentation & Reporting**  
   - Added markdown in the notebook to explain each step  
   - Created this `README.md` to make the project easy to understand
